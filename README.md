# React + Express Video Project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack application built with React for the front end and Express.js for the back end. It allows users to upload, view, edit, and delete videos. The application also includes user authentication with JWT tokens.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A standard for creating access tokens for user authentication.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework for responsive design.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **MongoDB**: Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).


## Commands Explanation

### 1. Seed the Database
```sh
node seed.js
```
This command runs the `seed.js` script located in the `server` directory. The purpose of this script is to populate the database with fake data for testing purposes. Here's what happens when you run this command:
- **Connect to MongoDB**: The script establishes a connection to your MongoDB database.
- **Generate Fake Data**: Using the `faker` library, the script generates fake users and videos.
- **Save to Database**: The generated data is saved to the MongoDB database, providing you with sample data to use while testing the application.

### 2. Build the React Application
```sh
npm run build
```
This command is run from the `client` directory and it builds the React application for production. Here's what happens when you run this command:
- **Optimize for Production**: The build process optimizes the app for best performance, including minification and tree-shaking.
- **Generate Static Files**: It creates a `build` directory containing all the static files needed to deploy the application. These files include the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **Ready for Deployment**: The contents of the `build` directory can be served by any static file server, making the app ready for deployment.

### Sequence of Commands
1. **Run `node seed.js`**: This should be run first to ensure your database is populated with fake data.
2. **Run `npm run build`**: After seeding the database, build the React application to prepare it for production deployment.

These commands help in setting up the development environment with necessary data and optimizing the client-side code for deployment.
