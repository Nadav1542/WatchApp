To run the code, go to the "webapp" folder and run the command "npm start".  

Work process: First, we created html templates for the pages as a "skeleton" for the future page structure. That is, the templates were the prototypes of the screens.

After that we moved each code of a page to React environment and divided everything into components. 
The application ran from 'app' and according to the user's clicks it displays the required pages with the help of 'routes' for each page.
We divided the components into folders according to their presentation logic. Also, when we were required to do so, we created css files and placed them in the appropriate folders. Along the way we changed the appearance of the pages according to our needs and to maintain order.
